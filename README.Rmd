# mzRAPP

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of mzRAPP is to allow reliability assessment of non-targeted data pre-processing (NPP) in the realm of liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). This is achieved by utilizing user provided information on a set of molecules (at best > 50) with known retention behavior. mzRAPP extracts and validates chromatographic peaks for all (envipat predicted) isotopologues of those target molecules directly from mzML files. The resulting benchmark dataset is used to extract different performance measures for NPP performed on the same mzML files.  

## Installation

You can install the released version of mzRAPP from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("mzRAPP")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("YasinEl/mzRAPP")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(mzRAPP)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
